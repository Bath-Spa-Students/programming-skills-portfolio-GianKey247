quote = "Yes. You aren't the only one to grow up on the killing fields.\n \
War is a cruel parent, but an effective teacher.\n \
Its final lesson is carved deep in my psyche:\n \
That this world and all its people are diseased.\n \
Free Will is a myth; Religion is a joke.\n \
We are all pawns, controlled by something greater:\n \
Memes. The DNA of the soul.\n \
They shape our will.\n \
They are the culture -- they are everything we pass on.\n \
Expose someone to anger long enough, they will learn to hate.\n \
They become a carrier... Envy, Greed, Despair...\n \
All memes. All passed along."
